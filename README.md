# AmigaED
qAmigaED is an enhanced example for writing a coder's editor using Qt5 and QScintilla, containig a menu bar, toolbar, menus and some sophisticated editing actions. The source is based on QScintilla's original editor example. This project was started as an entry point for learning how to use QScintilla. Though somewhat of a working editor, the project is meant for studies and as a base for own enhancements. Feel free to use it!
